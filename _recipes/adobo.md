## Ingredients

- 1 lb cubed beef
- 4 chicken thighs, skin-on and bone-in

- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Rice:**
   - Start the rice cooker with white rice, so it’s ready by the time the adobo is done.

2. **Brown the Meat (Optional):**
   - In a large pot, add the cubed beef and chicken thighs. Brown them over medium-high heat if desired for added flavor.

3. **Add Aromatics and Liquids:**
   - Once the meat is browned, add the bay leaves, soy sauce, water, white vinegar, sugar, garlic, and freshly ground black pepper to the pot.
