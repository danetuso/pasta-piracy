### Ingredients
- 8 oz Italian bacon (such as guanciale or pancetta), cut into small chunks
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/2 cup red wine (choose a wine you enjoy drinking)
- 1 lb cherry tomatoes (sliced or whole)
- 1/4 cup starchy pasta water
- 1 lb pasta of choice (spaghetti or rotini work well)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
- Salt, to taste

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Bacon**:
   - Cut the Italian bacon into small chunks, less than half an inch.
   - Add the bacon chunks to a cold pan. Set the pan over medium heat and stir consistently. Render the bacon fat until the bacon is fully cooked and crispy.
   - Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set it aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Remove 75% of the bacon grease from the pan.

2. **Sauté Aromatics**:
   - In the remaining bacon grease, add the chopped onions, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the onions become translucent and aromatic, stirring occasionally.

3. **Deglaze and Simmer**:
   - Pour in the red wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any brown bits stuck to the bottom. Reduce the wine over medium heat until it’s almost completely evaporated, removing any bitterness.

4. **Cook the Pasta**:
   - While the wine reduces, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add salt generously and cook the pasta according to the package instructions until it's just shy of al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water before draining.

5. **Tomato Sauce**:
   - Add the cherry tomatoes to the pan with the onions and garlic. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, cover, and cook until the tomatoes begin to split and soften, stirring occasionally.

   - Use a fork or masher to break up about 90% of the tomatoes. Increase the heat to high to reduce the liquid. Add the reserved pasta water to help thicken the sauce as it reduces.

6. **Combine and Finish**:
   - Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, lower the heat to medium. Add the bacon back into the pan along with the mostly cooked pasta. Drizzle a bit of high-quality olive oil over the top.
   - Stir everything together until the pasta is fully cooked and has absorbed some of the sauce. Add freshly grated Parmesan cheese for the final stir, if desired.

7. **Optional Garlic Toast**:
   - For a quick and easy garlic toast, dip slices of bread into the bacon grease left in the pan before adding the wine. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake until crispy and golden.
