## Ingredients

- 6 sweet Italian sausage links (4 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- ½ medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ cup white wine (adjust to taste)

## Instructions

1. **Brown the Sausages:**
   - Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Brown the sausage links evenly on all sides for about 5-7 minutes. Once done, remove from the skillet and slice into rounds.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - In the same skillet, melt the butter. Add the sliced onions and minced garlic, cooking for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Toss in the bell peppers, sprinkle with basil and oregano, and pour in the white wine.

   - Return the sliced sausages to the skillet. Lower the heat, cover, and let it all simmer for about 15 minutes until the sausages are heated through. Add more wine if the mixture becomes too dry.
